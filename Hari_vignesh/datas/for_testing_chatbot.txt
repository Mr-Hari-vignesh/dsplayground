(Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
 algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data,
 and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains
[Statistics,
 Visualization,
 Deep Learning,
 Machine Learning are important Data Science concepts]
 To know more visit here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science ).

(Data engineers build systems for collecting, validating, and preparing that high-quality data,
 Data engineers gather and prepare the data and data scientists use the data to promote better business decisions
 In order to perform their responsibilities efficiently and effectively, data engineers must possess the following technical and soft skills:
1)Coding
2)Data warehousing
3)Knowledge of operating systems
4)Database systems
5)Data analysis
6)Critical thinking skills
7)Basic understanding of machine learning
8)Communication skills

(PowerBI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent,
 visually immersive, and interactive insights, Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet,
 or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses,
 one of the most important skills that a Power BI Developer must have is proficiency or familiarity with data science, business intelligence, and data analytics,
 Power BI Developer must also be aware of :
1) data integration
2) data warehousing, 
3) modeling along with presentation tactics and concepts

(A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software
 In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue) 
 Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
 To know more visit here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stack ).

(A DevOps engineer is an IT generalist who should have a wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations,
 including coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps toolchains,
 DevOps engineers should also possess interpersonal skills since they work across company silos to create a more collaborative environment

(Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language,
 Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation,
 Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected,
 It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming).

(PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark ,
 It not only allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs,
 but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data in a distributed environment
 PySpark supports most of Sparkâ€™s features such as Spark SQL, DataFrame, Streaming, MLlib (Machine Learning) and Spark Core).

(SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system,
 or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system ).

(Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible).

(C is a general-purpose computer programming language, It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential,
 By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs )
 The C programming language is the recommended language for creating embedded system drivers and applications,
 The availability of machine-level hardware APIs, as well as the presence of C compilers, dynamic memory allocation,
 and deterministic resource consumption, make this language the most popular ).

(Machine language is a low-level language made up of binary numbers or bits that a computer can understand,
 It is also known as machine code or object code and is extremely tough to comprehend, The only language that the computer understands is machine language,
 All programmes and programming languages, such as Swift and C++, produce or run programmes in machine language before they are run on a computer, When a specific task,
 even the smallest process executes, machine language is transported to the system processor, Computers are only able to understand binary data as they are digital devices).

(Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example,
 Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost ).

(Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like humans, For example,
 speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning).
